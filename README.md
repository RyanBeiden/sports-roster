# Baggy Greens 🏏

This web app utilizes the CRUD method with Firebase/Axios all built on React. This was my first attempt at using React with Firebase. The basic layout of the app is you sign in through Google, then add your players to the cricket team! There is a form to input the player's name, an image, and their position on the field. You can either fire the player or edit their details, and Firebase will update in realtime along with a re-render in React.
